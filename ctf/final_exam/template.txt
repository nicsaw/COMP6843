# COMP6[48]43 Final Exam

Do NOT modify the heading structure of this markdown file.

i.e. do not change the existing or create new lines of text starting with `#` or `=` (code comments within backtick (`) delimited code blocks are fine).

Write your answer/writeup for each question under the corresponding heading. For challenges, if you find the flag, include the flag in full at the end of your writeup.

This file should be submitted to Moodle as a text (.txt) file. If you submit other formats, including PDF, Rich Text (.rtf) or Word Document (.docx, .doc, etc.), the file will be converted to a text file and you will not receive the bonus marks for following instructions.

Following the above instructions correctly will gain you two bonus marks (capped at 100% marks). All questions are marked out of 5 and each part of the exam is weighted equally, even though they have a different number of questions.

You are welcome (but not required) to use markdown formatting (see https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). You must still submit a plain text file regardless of if you use markdown formatting.
